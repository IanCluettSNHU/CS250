Software Development Lifecycle Class

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

Interpreting user needs depends on the level of information recieved. How the feedback was gained is the largest factor in how the user needs are interpreted. Breaking user needs into individual tasks, and turning them into "user stories" allows me to gain a tangible understanding of what the user wants. This allows me to properly implement what the user wants, and if it turns out to be wrong then the cycle can repeat until it is correctly implemented. 

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

I approach development firstly by creating an outline of what needs to be done. This includes pseduocode, flowcharts, outlines, or other similar visual aids to assist me when writing the code. I try to avoid being too specific in the outline methods so as to avoid spending too much time on one particular aspect. I can always go back to improve things later, functionality trumps perfection in my eyes. I like the agile process of visual aids like kan-ban boards, this is something that can be implemented into any project whether or not I am working solo or on a team. I am a big fan of tracking progress, it is motivating to have a tangible grasp of how far along a project I am.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

A good team member in software development is someone who is motivated, willing to accept mistakes, willing to share knowledge, and most importantly willing to learn.
